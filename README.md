### 💡 Examples <a name="examples"></a>
 1. Download the [VOC](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/VOCtrainval_11-May-2012.tar) image dataset, and split the dataset into train and val parts as follows:
```
dataset
├── train
│   ├── images
|   |     ├──xxx.jpg
|   |     └......
│   ├── labels
|   |     ├──xxx.xml
|   |     └......
├── val
│   ├── images
|   |     ├──zzz.jpg
|   |     └......
│   ├── labels
|   |     ├──zzz.xml
|   |     └......
```

 2. Download the yolo4_tiny pretrained weight [here](https://github.com/AllentDan/LibtorchDetection/releases/download/0.1/yolo4_tiny.pt). And load it into your cpp project as follows:
```cpp
Detector detector;
detector.Initialize(-1, /*gpu id, -1 for cpu*/
                    416, /*resize width*/
                    416, /*resize height*/
                    "your path to class name.txt");
detector.Train("your path to dataset dir", 
                    ".jpg", /*image type*/
                    30,/*training epochs*/
                    4, /*batch size*/
                    0.001, /*learning rate*/
                    "path to save detector.pt",
                    "path to load pretrained yolo4_tiny.pt");
```

 3. Predicting test. A detector.pt file is provided in the project [here](https://github.com/AllentDan/LibtorchDetection/releases/download/0.1/detector.pt) (trained on VOC for one epoch, just for testing...). Click and download, then you can directly test the detection result through:
```cpp
cv::Mat image = cv::imread("your path to 2007_005331.jpg");
Detector detector;
detector.Initialize(0, 416, 416, "your path to voc_classes.txt");
detector.LoadWeight("detector.pt"/*the saved .pt path*/);
detector.Predict(image, true,/*show result or not*/, 0.1, /*confidence thresh*/, 0.3/*nms thresh*/);
```
the predicted result shows as follow:

### 🧑‍🚀 Train your own data <a name="trainingOwn"></a>
- Create your own dataset. Using [labelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) through "pip install" and label your images. Split the output xml files and images into folders just like the example above.

- Training or testing. Just like the example of VOC detection, replace with your own dataset path.


### 🛠 Installation <a name="installation"></a>
**Dependency:**

- [Opencv 3+](https://opencv.org/releases/)
- [Libtorch 1.7+](https://pytorch.org/)

**Windows:**

Configure the environment for libtorch development. [Visual studio](https://allentdan.github.io/2020/03/05/windows-libtorch-configuration/) and [Qt Creator](https://allentdan.github.io/2020/03/05/QT-Creator-Opencv-Libtorch-CUDA-English/) are verified for libtorch1.7+.

**Linux && MacOS:**

Install libtorch and opencv. 

For libtorch, follow the official pytorch c++ tutorials [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_export.html).

For opencv, follow the official opencv install steps [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv).

If you have already configured them both, congratulations!!! Download the pretrained weight [here](https://github.com/AllentDan/LibtorchDetection/releases/download/0.1/yolo4_tiny.pt) and a demo .pt file [here](https://github.com/AllentDan/LibtorchDetection/releases/download/0.1/detector.pt) into weights. Change the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH to your own in CMakeLists.txt. Then just do the following:
```
cd build
cmake ..
make
./LibtorchDetection
```

### ⏳ ToDo <a name="todo"></a>
- [ ] More detection architectures, mainly one-stage algorithms.
- [ ] Data augmentations.
- [ ] Training tricks.

### 🤝 Thanks <a name="thanks"></a>
